# Test for backend engineering candidates

## Background

At Lendsqr, many of our lenders use our mobile apps to reach over half a million customers. At this scale, we use NodeJS with TypeScript as its backend software development stack which allows us to rapidly ideate and release features and functionality.

To prepare for you as a possible backend engineer at Lendsqr, we would require that you create an application using NodeJS with TypeScript. This test will allow us to assess your strengths and weaknesses.

## Assessment

Demo Credit is a mobile lending app that requires wallet functionality. This is needed as borrowers need a wallet to receive the loans they have been granted and also send the money for repayments.

### You are required to build an MVP (Minimum viable product) wallet service where:

- A user can create an account

- A user can withdraw funds from their account.
  Your task is to present
- A readme design document for your implementation
